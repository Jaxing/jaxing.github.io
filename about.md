Hi, my name is Jesper Jaxing, a Software Engineer in training. 
As of right now I am just about to start the fall semest of my fourth year at Chalmers.
At Chalmers I have done a bunch of things, chairman for a event organization group, member of the student union division board, started a craft brewers club, and more!
My major have been software engineering/computer science with some focus on machine learning. Druing my bachlors thesis we tried to create a neural net that could take a post from reddit and output which user would find that post intersting. A sort of smart notifcation algorithm, sadly we realized to late that it is not optimal to try to do multi-classification on 10's of thousands and the result never got very good. However I learned incredably much during that time.

Next adventure is going to be to find an intership in the US and spend a year working in SF!
