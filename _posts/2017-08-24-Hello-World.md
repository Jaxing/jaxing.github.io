As is custom the first message on this blog will be Hello World!
I have just created this site and hopefully I will have time to do some changes to it. Right now this is not my site but pretty much a standard jekyll site with some tweeks from a guide I found.

This page will give some insight in what is going on in my academic and proffesional life. Not so much for others as for me to be able to track my progress.

It is also a site to better showcase my resume as well as for me to learn some more about web development (we will see if I get to that).
